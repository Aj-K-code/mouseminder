# MouseMinder

A fun tool to help you stop fidgeting with your mouse. If you move your mouse too much without clicking, MouseMinder will give you a playful warning and temporarily lock your cursor in the center of the screen for a timeout.

## Features (Planned)

-   Detects excessive mouse movement without clicking.
-   Displays a humorous animated emoji with a message.
-   Locks the mouse cursor in the center of the screen for a short timeout.
-   Tiered timeout system (warning, short lock, long lock).
-   Customizable sensitivity, timeout durations, and messages.
-   Tracks fidgeting statistics.
-   Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
